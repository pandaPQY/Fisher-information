\begin{section}{Conclusion}
  \label{sec:conclusion}
  We have considered neutrinos as a dispersive fluid and found that
  this provides additional physical insights into their clustering
  behaviour.  We have computed the sound speed and shown that it
  depends on the intial neutrino velocity distribution and also the
  non-linear cold dark matter.  We find that the excess in power
  observed in the N-body neutrino power spectrum compared to linear
  response can be explained via a higher-order modification to the
  sound speed.  Based on this, we have provided a simple model for the
  neutrino power spectrum that requires no additional integration
  beyond standard Boltzmann code outputs.  Finally, we speculate that
  treating neutrinos as a dispersive fluid could allow for them to be
  simulated efficiently in both memory and processing time.
