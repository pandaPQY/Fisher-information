\begin{section}{Introduction}
  \label{sec:introduction}
  
  Power spectrum of matter density field is essential in modern cosmology research since it is related to many cosmology parameters. Many dedicated experiments attemp to constrain some specific parameters. 

  Fisher information is widely used for making predictions for the errors and covariances of parameter estimates. Rimes and Hamilton first studied the Fisher information as a function of scale contained in the matter power spectrum. 

  Many approach were put forward to recover parts of the lost information in the power spectrum of matter density field. 

  Some reconstruction methods are also proposed in order to understand the highly non-linear process to produce the matter density field.

  This paper is organized as follows.
