\begin{section}{Reconstruction Algorithm}
  \label{sec:reconstruction}
    We use the algorithm and numerical method called Adaptive Particle-mesh (APM), discribed in \cite{bib:Pen1995,bib:Pen1998}. to reconstruct the density field. The basic idea is to build a PM scheme on a curvilinear coordinate system, in which the number of the particles per grid cell is set approximately constant. 
    Consider a numerical grid of curvilinear coordinates $\bm{\xi}=\left(\xi_1,\xi_2,\xi_3\right)$. In order to determine the physical position of each grid point, one needs to specify the Euclidean coordinate $\bm{x}(\bm{\xi},t)$ as a function of grid position. In the Euclidean coordinate, the flat metric is Kronecker delta function $\delta_{ij}$, while the curvilinear metric is given by
\begin{align}
    g_{\mu\nu}=\frac{\partial x^i}{\partial \xi ^\mu} \frac{\partial x^j}{\partial \xi ^\nu}\delta_{ij}.
\end{align}
    We use the convention that Latin indices denote Cartesian coordinate, while Greek indices denote the curvilinear grid coordinate.
    In principle, there are many different methods to connect the Cartesian coordiante and curvilinear coordinate of each grid cell. In APM method, the connetction is described by an irrotational deformation,
\begin{align}
    x^i=\xi ^\mu \delta ^i _\mu + \Delta x^i,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:disp}
    \Delta x^i=\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial \xi ^ \nu}\delta ^i _\nu .
\end{align}
    This choice of the deformation can minimize mesh distortion and twisting. $\phi$ is called the deformation potential, and $\Delta x^i$ the lattice displacement. The deformation potential can be given in terms of the continuity equation in curvilinear coordinate,
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:continue_eq}
    \frac{\partial \sqrt{g} \rho }{\partial t}+\partial_\mu \left[\rho \sqrt{g} e^\mu _i \left(v^i - \Delta \dot{x}^i \right) \right] =0
\end{align}
where $\sqrt{g} \equiv (\partial x^i / \partial \xi ^ \alpha)$ is the volume element and $e^i _\mu = \partial \xi ^\mu / \partial x^i$ is the triad. $\Delta \dot{x}=\delta ^{i\nu}\partial _\nu dot{\phi}$ is chosen such that the first term in equation \ref{eq:continue_eq} is zero, resulting in a constant mass per volume element. And the velocity field divergence is replaced by the deviation density field $\Delta \rho = \bar{\rho}-\rho \sqrt{g}$, which ideally should be zero. Then the deformation potential is described in the elliptic equation,
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:li_elip}
    \partial _\mu (\rho \sqrt{g} e^\mu _i \delta^{i\nu}\partial_\nu \Delta \phi)=\Delta \rho
\end{align}
The equation \ref{eq:li_elip} can be solved using multigrid algorithm described in Ref. .... Then the displacement is given by the gradiant of the deformation potential as in \ref{eq:disp}. One layer of the deformed grids and the original density field of that layer is given in Fig. \ref{fig:simandrec}. As expeted, there's no grid crossing after reconstruction.
