We adapt a new reconstruction method called Adaptive particle mesh (APM) to 136 non-linear density fields given by independent N-body simulations, in order to recover some of the information lost in the non-linear regime of large-scale structure. Through analyzing the power spectra of both density fields from simulations and deformation potentials from reconstructions, we find that after reconstruction, the non-linear regime of correlation matrix shinks to some extent. We also find that the Fisher information has a increase by a factor up to 20 at the translinear plateau.
