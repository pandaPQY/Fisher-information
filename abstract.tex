  Reconstruction techniques are commonly used in cosmology to reduce
  complicated nonlinear behaviours to achieve a more tractable linearized
  system.  We study a new reconstruction technique, which uses the
  Moving-Mesh algorithm to estimate the displacement field
  from nonlinear matter distribution. We show the performance of this
  new technique by quantifying its ability to reconstruct linear
  modes. We study the cumulative Fisher information $I(<k)$ in the matter power spectrum
  in 130 $N$-body simulations before and after reconstruction, and find that the
  linear scale is pushed to $k\simeq 0.3$ h/Mpc after
  reconstruction. We furthermore find that the non-linear plateau of
  $I(<k)$ is increased by a factor of $\sim 50$ after reconstruction, from
  $I \simeq 2.5 \times 10^{-5} /({\rm Mpc}/h)^3$ to
  $I \simeq 1.3 \times 10^{-3}/({\rm Mpc}/h)^3$ at $k \simeq 2.7$ $h$/Mpc.
  This result includes the decorrelation between initial and final fields,
  which has been neglected in some previous studies, which artificially
  improved their performance.  We expect this technique to be
  beneficial to problems such as baryonic acoustic oscillations and
  cosmic neutrinos that rely on an accurate disentangling of nonlinear
  evolution from underlying linear effects.
