  Reconstruction techniques are commonly used in cosmology to reduce
  complicated nonlinear behaviour to a more tractable linearized
  system.  We study the \textit{Moving-Mesh} algorithm which is
  expected to perform better than many alternatives as it is based in
  Lagrangian space.  To quantify the algorithm's ability to
  reconstruct linear modes, we study the Fisher information presented
  in 136 N-body simulations before and after reconstruction.  We find
  that the linear scale is pushed to $k\simeq$ 0.3 $h/\mathrm{Mpc}$
  after reconstruction. We furthermore find that the translinear
  plateau of the cumulative Fisher information is increased by a
  factor of $\sim 40$ after reconstruction, from
  $I \simeq 2.5 \times 10^{-5} /(\mathrm{Mpc}^3/h^3)$ to
  $I \simeq 10^{-3}/(\mathrm{Mpc}^3/h^3)$ at $k \simeq$ 1
  $h/\mathrm{Mpc}$.  This includes the decorrelation between initial
  and final fields, which has been neglected in many previous studies,
  and we find that the log-normal transform in this metric only gains
  a factor of 4 in information.  We expect this technique to be
  beneficial to problems such as baryonic acoustic oscillations and
  cosmic neutrinos that rely on an accurate disentangling of nonlinear
  evolution from underlying linear effects.
