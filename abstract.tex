\begin{abstract}
A new reconstruction method using the algorithm originally aiming at improving 
the resolution of N-body simulation called Adaptive particle mesh (APM) is 
recently introduced into comology matter field, which is expected to give a 
better reconstruction from non-linear density fields to linear ones in many 
cases. We are motivated to adapt this method to test the information content 
difference, checking the effect of the reconstruction method. We reconstruct 
136 non-linear density fields given by independent N-body simulations, in 
order to recover some of the information lost in the non-linear regime of 
large-scale structure. Through analyzing the power spectra of both density 
fields from simulations and deformation potentials from reconstructions, we 
find that after reconstruction, the non-linear regime of correlation matrix 
shinks to $k\sim0.4-0.5$. We also find that the information content has a increase 
by a factor up to 40 at the translinear plateau.
