\begin{section}{Implementation and Power Spectra}
  \label{sec:simulation}
  We use the \textsc{CUBEP$^3$M} code \cite{bib:Harnois2013} to run
  140 simulations with a box size of 600 Mpc/h and $512^3$ particles.
  The initial conditions are computed using the transfer function
  given by CAMB \cite{bib:Lewis2000} and then propagating the power
  back to $z=100$ with a linear growth factor.  The Zel'dovich
  approximation is used to calculate the displacement and velocity
  fields of the particles.  For these simulations, we use cosmological
  parameters $\Omega_M=0.321$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}=1.0-\Omega_m$,
  $h=0.67$, $\sigma_8=0.83$, and $n_s=0.96$.  Different random seeds
  are used to produce the initial conditions for different simulations
  so that they are independent of each other.

 We use the Voronoi tessellation method to estimate the density contrast
 $\delta_S=\delta\rho/\rho-1$ from the particles, and then apply the
 MM reconstruction to these fields with a resolution of $512^3$ cells.
 The reconstruction code solves the dispacement potentials iteratively
 until the root mean square (rms) of the results drop from $\sim 7.5$
 to 0.20. For different simulation samples, a different number of
 iterations are required to get the results of the same rms. In total,
 130 simulations converged to the target rms within 2000 iterations.  A 2-D projection
 of one layer of the deformed grids and the original density field on
 the grids are given in Fig.~\ref{fig:simandrec}.  As expected, there
 is no grid crossing after reconstruction.
 
 The cross power spectrum, $P_{ab}(k)$, is defined as
 \begin{align}
   \langle \delta_a(\bm{k})\delta_b(\bm{k'}) \rangle =
   (2\pi)^3 P_{ab}(k) \delta_{3D}(\bm{k}-\bm{k'}),
 \end{align}
 where $\delta_{a}$ and $\delta_{b}$ are any density contrasts and
 $\delta_{3D}$ is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. We typically consider instead
 the dimensionless power spectrum, $\Delta_{ab}^2(k)$, defined as
 \begin{align}
   \Delta_{ab}^2(k) \equiv \frac{k^3 P_{ab}(k)}{2\pi ^2}.
 \end{align}
 In the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:cp}, we show the matter auto power
 spectrum ($a=b$) of linear theory density fields ($\delta_L$), from
 the simulation results ($\delta_S$) and after reconstruction
 ($\delta_R=-\nabla^2\phi$).  For the simulation
 results, we use the average value of all 130 simulations and show
 $1\sigma$ standard deviations as error bars.  

 To determine the correlation
 between fields, we compute the cross correlation coefficient
 $r_{ab}(k) = P_{ab}/\sqrt{P_{aa}P_{bb}}$.  In the right panel of
 Fig.~\ref{fig:cp}, we show $r_{SL}$ and $r_{RL}$.  We see that the
 reconstructed field is much more highly correlated with the linear
 field than the simulation field is.  For comparison, we also plot the 
 correlation coefficient of $\delta_E$ 
 and $\delta_L$ from \citet{bib:Yu2016}, 
 where $\delta_E(\bs{q})= - \nabla_q \cdot \bs{\Psi}(\bs{q})$ is the 
 negative divergence of the real non-linear displacement from simulaiton. 
 Ideally, the MM algorithm aims to get the cross correlation $r_{RL}$ close to $r_{EL}$. 
 Even though $r_{RL}$ decreases from $r_{EL}$ in the non-linear regime, due to the fact that the MM reconstruction 
 cannot recover the cell-crossing and vorticity present on these scales, we find that linear modes are recovered successfully on scales $k\simeq 0.05 - 0.3$ h/Mpc.
 Specifically, the scale at which $r(k)=1/2$ increases from $k\simeq 0.2$ h/Mpc to
 $0.8$ h/Mpc after reconstruction.  In comparison with the results of \citet{bib:ZhuH2016},
 we find the correlation coefficient falls off at slightly lower
 wavenumbers, which we attribute to using fewer particles per simulation.
