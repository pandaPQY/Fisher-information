\begin{section}{Conclusion}
  \label{sec:conclusion}
  From 130 large scale structure $N$-body simulations, 
  we study the moving-mesh algorithm on the estimation of the underlying displacement
  field and the reconstruction of linear density fields in Lagrangian
  space. We measure the power spectra and their covariance of
  the original nonlinear density fields $\delta_N$, reconstructed density fields $\delta_R$.
  We quantify the result by (i) cross-correlating them respect to linear density fields $\delta_L$ (Fig. \ref{fig:cp}),
  (ii) studying the $k$-mode coupling in the covariance matrix (Fig. \ref{fig:corrall}), and (iii)
  computing the cumulative Fisher information contained
  in these power spectra (Fig. \ref{fig:fisherinfo}). We also apply $E$-mode reconstruction
  and logarithmic transformation Gaussianization and compare
  with the moving-mesh reconstruction result. We show
  that the moving-mesh method gives better results than previous works
  (e.g. \cite{bib:Mark2006,bib:Mark2009,bib:Zhang2011,bib:HarnoisD2013}),
  and on our scales of interest (BAO), the result is comparable to
  the optimal $E$-mode reconstruction case \citep{bib:Yu2016}.
  Next steps are to overcome the Poisson and bias contaminations
  from realities, and to quantify the error propagation onto
  the BAO measurements.
