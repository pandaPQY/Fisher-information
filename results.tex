\begin{section}{Conclusion}
  \label{sec:conclusion}
  We study the \tcr{Potential Isobaric (PI) reconstruction}'s ability to estimate the underlying displacement 
  field and reconstruct the linear density fields using 130 cosmological $N$-body 
  simulations.  We measure the power spectra and the associated covariance of the 
  nonlinear density fields, and the reconstructed density fields.  We quantify the 
  result by (i) cross-correlating them with the linear density fields, (ii) studying 
  the $k$-mode coupling in the correlation matrix, and (iii) computing the cumulative 
  Fisher information contained in these power spectra.  We also
  compared with the $E$-mode 
  reconstruction and logarithmic density mapping Gaussianization
  techniques.
  We find that \tcr{PI} method gives better results than previous works
  (e.g. \citealt{bib:Mark2009,bib:Zhang2011,bib:HarnoisD2013}), and on scales 
  relevant to the BAO, our result approaches the optimal $E$-mode reconstruction.  
  The advantage of this method is that it doesn't include cosmological dynamics and thus 
  no cosmological assumptions are required.
  Future steps include quantifying halo Poisson noise and bias contamination 
  from realistic measurements, and determining the quantitative impact on
  BAO and RSD measurements.
