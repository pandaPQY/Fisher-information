\begin{section}{Conclusion}
  \label{sec:conclusion}
  The MM reconstruction method successfully recovers the lost linear
  information on mildly non-linear scales and increases the saturated
  information from $I \simeq 2.5 \times 10^{-5}/(\mathrm{(Mpc/h)}^3)$
  to at least $I \simeq 1.3 \times 10^{-3}/\mathrm{(Mpc/h)}^3$.  The result is
  better than previous methods,
  e.g. \cite{bib:Mark2006,bib:Mark2009,bib:Zhang2011,bib:Yu2012}, and
  we may improve further as the correlation coefficient between the
  reconstructed and linear fields will increase with higher resolution
  simulations \cite{bib:ZhuH2016}.  This successful result on cold
  dark matter density fields provides strong motivation to adapt the
  MM reconstruction scheme to other cosmological fields such as biased
  tracers like halos and other matter components like baryons and
  neutrinos.

  % The result in dark matter density fields gives a strong motivation
  % to adapt the MM reconstruction to halo fields, neutrino fields,
  % etc, so that we have access to the physics in smaller scales.

  % Reconstruction technique are concerned to improve cosmology
  % measurements of BAO scale
  % (e.g. \cite{bib:Daniel2007,bib:Martin2015}).  The successful
  % application of the MM reconstruction on BAO reconstruction in 1D
  % \cite{bib:Zhu2016} and 3D \cite{bib:ZhuH2016} cosmology provide an
  % intuitive view of the algorithm to push forward BAO research.

  % The MM reconstruction effectively decomposes the irrotational part
  % and the curl part of the displacement field of particles. However,
  % the reconstructed displacement might be greatly different from the
  % real displacement in N-body simulation, since it is sensitive to
  % the
  % late stage shell-crossing and nonlinear process so that the
  % original
  % position of some spectific particles are replaced by each other.
  % It
  % is meaningful to compare the irrotational displacement field
  % through
  % the MM reocnstruction and through $E$-mode displacement
  % reconstruction \cite{bib:Yu2016}.  Since the MM reconstruction
  % only
  % needs the density field input and gives a large amount of
  % recovering
  % of lost information, it's expected to have a good effect on
  % reconstructing the matter density field from observation.
