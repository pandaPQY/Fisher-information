\begin{section}{Discussion and Conclusion}
 \label{sec:conclusion}
The new reconstruction method successfully recovers the lost linear 
information on the mildly nonlinear scale, increasing the saturated 
information from $I \simeq 2.5 \times 10^{-5}/(\mathrm{Mpc}^3/h^3)$ 
to at least $I \simeq 10^{-3}/(\mathrm{Mpc}^3/h^3)$, and pushing the 
nonlinear scale to higher $k$. 
The result is better than previous methods 
(e.g. \cite{bib:Mark2006,bib:Mark2009,bib:Zhang2011,bib:Yu2012}), 
and we believe that the reconstructed Fisher information will further 
increase to a greater magnitude in smaller scale since the cross 
correlation of the reconstructed power spectrum with the linear one 
increases in a higher resolution analysis \cite{bib:ZhuH2016}.
The result in dark matter density fields gives a strong motivation to 
adapt the MM reconstruction to halo fields, neutrino fields, etc, so 
that we have access to the physics in smaller scales. 

Reconstruction technique are concerned to improve cosmology measurements 
of BAO scale (e.g. \cite{bib:Daniel2007,bib:Martin2015}). 
The successful application of the MM reconstruction on BAO reconstruction 
in 1D \cite{bib:Zhu2016} and 3D \cite{bib:ZhuH2016} cosmology provide 
an intuitive view of the algorithm to push forward BAO research.

The MM reconstruction effectively decomposes the irrotational part and 
the curl part of the displacement field of particles. However, the 
reconstructed displacement might be greatly different from the real 
displacement in N-body simulation, since it is sensitive to the late 
stage shell-crossing and nonlinear process so that the original position 
of some spectific particles are replaced by each other. 
It is meaningful to compare the irrotational displacement field through 
the MM reocnstruction and through $E$-mode displacement reconstruction 
\cite{bib:Yu2016}.  
Since the MM reconstruction only needs the density field input and gives 
a large amount of recovering of lost information, it's expected to have 
a good effect on reconstructing the matter density field from observation.
