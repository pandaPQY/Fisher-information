% The following three macros provide auxiliary support for the BibTeX
% wranglings in mn2e.bst.  They provide support for functionality
% which it is impossible, or at least unmaintainably arcane, to
% provide within BibTeX Style Language.
%
% These definitions can be loaded as a package or, probably better,
% should be incorporated into a mn2e.cls file.



% \mniiiauthor{citekey}{first-use}{short-form}
%
% The following implements the three-author-hack described in mn2e.bst.
% That is: we give the 'author' of a reference as \mniiiauthor{}{}{},
% where the 'first-use' argument contains the long form of the trio of
% author names (eg "Cholmondeley, Featherstonehaugh and Beaulieu"), and
% the 'short-form' argument contains a shortened form (eg
% "Cholmondeley et al").  The 'first-use' form is used on the first
% citation of the names, and the 'short-form' thereafter.
%
% Within captions, use only the 'short-form', and do not count this as
% the first use of the name.
%
% This consumes a command for each such author.  It's surely possible
% to avoid this (with some constructions involving {\\#1}; see
% Appendix D cleverness), but that would verge on the unmaintainably
% arcane, and not be really worth it.
